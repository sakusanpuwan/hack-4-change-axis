# AXIS
The winning 'hack' entry for Bright Network Technology Academy's 2023 Hack For Change: Harnessing AI for Good competition

AXIS is a solution to make the workplace more accessible to neurodiverse individuals. Focusing on this goal, our hack utilised AI to offer a suite of tools including audio, speech-to-tech and enhanced readability to ensure that every employee has the resources they need to shine - increasing productivity, breading creativity, and driving inclusion within the workplace.

Axis’ primary goal is to increase accessibility by finding innovative solutions that will help employers to support their neurodiversity employees and reduce barriers to work for neurodiverse individuals - as research estimates that approximately 1 in 7 people in the UK are neurodivergent. 

It’s not just aimed at neurodiverse candidates either – as Axis aims to redefine productivity by giving every employee AI powered assistance with their reading and writing tasks.
